## Biography:

Ibrahim Khalil is a professor in School of Computing Technologies (Computer Science), RMIT
University, Melbourne, Australia. Ibrahim obtained his Ph.D. in 2003 from the University of Berne
in Switzerland. He has several years of experience in Silicon Valley, California based networking
companies as software engineers working on secure network protocols and smart network service
provisioning. He worked for EPFL and University of Berne in Switzerland and Osaka University in
Japan before joining RMIT University, Australia in 2004.

Ibrahim leads a fairly large research group with approximately 10 PhD students and
supervised 24 PhD students towards completions. His research interests are in security and
scalable computing in distributed systems such as IoT, Fog, Cloud, Smart Grid, and Remote Health.
The specific application areas he is interested in are secure sensor/IoT data analytics, m-health/e-
health, wireless body sensor networks, secure IoT applications. Ibrahim and his research team
have developed Fully Homomorphic based privacy preserving techniques for Big Data on cloud.
This involves data analytics of encrypted data on cloud without any decryption. Since working on
encrypted data is extremely time-consuming, Ibrahimâ€™s research group have built innovative
distributed computing techniques to speed up computations. In recent past, Ibrahim has also
contributed in the area of remote cardiac monitoring for elderly people. With cardiovascular
disease as the number one killer of modern era, Electrocardiogram (ECG) is collected, stored and
transmitted in greater frequency than ever before. However, in reality, ECG is rarely transmitted
and stored in an efficient and secured manner. Ibrahim has developed ECG compression
algorithms, cardiovascular diagnosis methods, secure transmission and storage techniques for
remote cardiac monitoring applications. Such applications will enable patients to stay at home
while being continuously monitored by medical service providers.

Ibrahim received serveral research awards during his career. He is recipient of IEEE LCN
2001 Best Paper award for A Range-Based SLA and Edge Driven Virtual Core Provisioning in
DiffServ-VPNs, and Joint author of a Best paper at MobiHealth 2011, Greece. Ibrahim received the
prestigious Fritz-Kutter award for the best practice oriented PhD thesis in Computer Science in
whole Switzerland during the academic year 2002/2003. He was interviewed by IEEE Spectrum for
the pioneering work on ECG Steganogrpahy which was published in IEEE TMBE. The interview has
been published in IEEE Spectrum Hiding Data in a HeartBeat. (available online:

Ibrahim is the Chief Investigators of prestigious few ARC discovery and linkage grants
awarded in Australia in 2017 and 2021. He is also the recipients of international European grants,
industry grants from Siemens, and QNRF grants from Qatar. Ibrahim has served as reviewers of IEEE Transactions on
Networking, IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications , IEEE Transactions on Parallel
and Distributed Systems, IEEE Transactions on Computers, IEEE Transactions on Mobile
Computing, Pattern Recognition, Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, Mobile and
Pervasive Commuting, Journal of Security and Communication Networks (Wiley), Journal of
Network and Computer Applications (Elsevier), and guest edited a special issue in IEEE Cloud
Computing. Ibrahim has also served as Technical Program Committee (TPC) members of several
international IEEE sponsored conferences: IEEE LCN (2005, 2006, 2007, 2008), IEEE Globecom
(2006,2007), IEEE ICC (2006,2007,2009,2010,2011), WWIC (2006, 2007, 2008).
